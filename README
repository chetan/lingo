ABOUT
-----

I needed to use Lingo in a project recently and found that it was asking for
all sorts of outdated libraries (e.g., Active MQ 4.0 from the Apache Incubator)
that Maven could no longer find. So this repository is simply Lingo trunk r183
with updated POM files. I also needed to make a few minor changes for a Spring
interface change.

USAGE
-----

Simply check out the repository and install the package.

$ git clone git://github.com/chetan/lingo.git
$ cd lingo
$ mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true source:jar install

Then include it in your application's POM as version 1.4-SNAPSHOT like so:

        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.logicblaze.lingo</groupId>
            <artifactId>lingo</artifactId>
            <version>1.4-SNAPSHOT</version>
        </dependency>

That's it!
